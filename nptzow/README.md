# nptzow/nowir

Caching SEO tool. Does different things for "humans" and for "bots".

Bots get some kind of spammy template filled out with text from ask.com and/or yahoo.com,
humans get redirected to a spammy website.
Any requests from bots also have keywords sent to a 3rd web site,
presumably for analytics or billing.

I've capture two versions:

nptzow downloaded 2017-11-23T16:20:58-07:00

nowir downloaded  2018-05-04T16:51:53-06:00

## Origin

PHP "dropper" code passed to a fake WSO ([Web Shell by oRb]())
via the `Php` action. WSO has a way to evaluate arbitrary PHP source
code via the `eval()` builtin. The "action" string and the PHP source
to eval arrive via POST parameters.

The fake WSO is part of a WordPress honeypot I've operated off and on
for the last 4 years. Everything assumed to happen in a WordPress
installation.

The downloader seems to believe that the WSO instance is hidden in
a "revslider" plugin.
[Revslider had an exploit](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/12/revslider-vulnerability-leads-to-massive-wordpress-soaksoak-compromise.html) in the December, 2014 timeframe,
and a lot of bottom feeders tried to exploit it at the time.

### Source IP Address

The nptzow code got downloaded from 194.165.16.79, which is 194.165.16.0/23AS48721,
a European IP address in Monaco, of all places. Reverse DNS lookup says it
has the host name `hostby.adm-service.org.`

`whois adm-service.org` yields some Monaco names, addresses and telephone numbers.

`whois 194.165.16.79` gives me some information about the AS, which is
registered to "ADM Service Ltd.", head office in Moscow.

The nowir variant got downloaded from 31.184.234.175, "hostby.gto-projects.biz".
31.184.234.175 is in 31.184.234.0/24AS44050, GTO LTD. in Podgorica, Montenegro.

## Dropper

The dropper code contains a blob of Base64-encoded bytes.
It creates a file name `4048ad7bdb2.php` somewhere in a WordPress
file tree. If a file named `4048ad7bdb2.php` already resides in
the WordPress file tree, it gets moved to `4048ad7bdb2.php_backup`.
The dropper decodes the PHP source, then writes it to `4048ad7bdb2.php`.
It echoes "OK file saved", which presumably lets the process
transferring the dropper code know that the file creation and
source decoding worked.

Like a lot of PHP malware, the dropper makes more than one attempt
to create `4048ad7bdb2.php`. The `file_write()` function returns
a boolean that isn't checked by the caller, and it has some
commented out code that appears to set a file's time stamp to
between 10 and 70 days in the past.

Stylistically, the dropper is only a little uneven. I hypothesize
that it hasn't evolved via feature addition yet.

## Decoding

The following notes are for nptzow, but the nowir process is very similar.

### Level 1 code

I got to level 1 code by hand-editing file `194.165.16.79WhdX2hdZm0Z2rcNQ09X9ZgAAAAA.php.file`
into file `dc1.php`. This is just the Base64-encoded string, and two
PHP function calls to create file `4048ad7bdb2.php` with the
Base64-decoded string in it.

### Level 2 code

Executing `dc1.php` yields file `4048ad7bdb2.php` which contains
yet another Based64-encoded block of bytes,
and a *native PHP* implementation of Gzip,
[class PclZip](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/includes/class-pclzip.php).

The level 2 code Base64-decodes a long string, and puts the results
in a file `nptzow.zip` or `nowir.zip`. It proceeds to unzip `nptzow.zip`. If that
succeeds, it echoes the string "1425756856". If unzipping fails,
it echoes PclZip error information. Presumably this lets the
accessor of `4048ad7bdb2.php` tell if the de-coding procedure worked or not.

### nptzow.zip

`nptzow.zip` expands into a directory full of goodies, one PHP
file and two subdirectories full of apparently template files.

### Directory nptzow/

#### De-obfuscate `flvoaw.php`

Pretty print `flvoaw.php` using [revphp](https://github.com/bediger4000/reverse-php-malware)

    revphp flvoaw.php > pp1.php

#### flvoaw.php

Based on my reading of `pp1.php`, the de-obfuscated PHP source,
`flvoaw.php` does different things for "bots" versus non-bots.
It decides bot-or-not based on user agent string, but it has
a problem. It sets a variable `$user_agent_to_filter` to 
an array full of strings that seem to represent the vast majority
of web spiders/search engines that come around these days.
It does not use `$user_agent_to_filter` anywhere. Instead it
checks a much smallar array, containing only some of the strings
in `$user_agent_to_filter`.

As an added bonus, it checks if the DNS name of `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` 
has "google" in it. If so, it's a bot.

##### Not a bot

If it decides you're not a bot, it sends you to a different URL, via:

    Location: http://caforyn.pw/for/77?d=$d&mykeys=$mykeys

The `$d` will be a string naming the host on which `floavw.php`
executes. `$mykeys` is a string derived from a GET paramenter
named `do` for nptzow, and `kfd` for nowir.

##### You are a bot

If it decides you are a bot, it looks in the `wtuds/` directory,
the cache folder, to find a file named by a GET parameter, itself
named `do`. If that file exists in the cache directory, it serves
up the HTML in the cached file.

If it doesn't find the file named by `$_GET['do']` in `wtuds/`,
it picks a file in the template directory (`sotpie/`).
It rather strangely uses `$_GET['do']` as a series of keywords,
then sends the keywords via URL
`http://boriskq.pw/story.php` (nptzow) or `http://solfinesew.pw/story2.php` (nowir).
I think this is for analytics or billing.
The SEO campaigner can see which keywords come from what compromised hosts.

If `floavw.php` doesn't get at least 1000 bytes from boriskq.pw,
it asks `ask.com`, `google.com` and `yahoo.com` for the same keywords
that it used on `story.php`.

It writes a file in the cache directory, then sends the HTML it
got from ask.com, google.com or yahoo.com

It looks like this is a simple caching SEO tool. It redirects
"humans" to some weird web site, and it makes, and then caches,
special spam HTML for "bots".

Unfortunately, nobody has invoked `nptzow/floavw.php`, so I can't
tell what keywords they send its way.

Both boriskq.pw and caforyn.pw are registered to:

	Admin Name: John
	Admin Organization: N/A
	Admin Street: North Road 35
	Admin City: Pirr
	Admin State/Province: South Dakota
	Admin Postal Code: 57501
	Admin Country: US
	Admin Phone: +1.208241712
	Admin Fax:
	Admin Email: magicforesh@gmail.com

Is "Pirr" some kind of joke?
The state capitol of South Dakota is [Pierre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre,_South_Dakota),
but apparently it's pronounced "Pirr" by locals.

#### subdirectory sotpie/

According to the de-obfuscated source code of `flvoaw.php`,
`sotpie/` is a template folder.

#### subdirectory wtuds/

According to the de-obfuscated source code of `flvoaw.php`,
`wtuds/` is a cache folder. `wtuds/` contains two files,
`sdsdg` and `grtjtyul`.

`sdsdg` contains some HTML, which identifies itself as having
been generated by "JohnCMS".  The interesting HTML tags are:

    &lt;meta name="keywords" content="Sdsdg"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="Sdsdg"&gt;


`grtjtyul` also contains some HTML, with "Grtjtyul" appearing
in several locations throughout.

### nowir.zip

`nowir.zip` unpacks similarly to `nptzow.zip`, but it has 3 PHP files, `sotpie/` and `wtuds/`
directories.

The 3 PHP files:

1. `ghkhjew.php`
2. `ohirjwe.php`
3. `lerbim.php`

`ghkhjew.php` and `ohirjwe.php` are nearly identical.
Only one line of code differs in indentation.
They're both similar to `nptzow/flvoaw.php`,
differing mainly in the URL that keywords from incoming requests get forwarded to,
and the URL that requests from not-a-bot get redirected to.

`lerbim.php` is a little more interesting.
It appears to rename files in or under the current directory
whose names have a ".php.suspected" suffix to a ".php" suffix.
This reverses the changes made by [Vigilante Malware Cleaner](../198.71.239.41-2018-05-19a)
when it disarms PHP malware.
I find this odd, as Vigilante Malware Cleaner does not appear to detect nowir or nptzow.

`ghkhjew.php` uses solfinesew.pw instead of boriskq.pw to send keywords queried.
As of 2018-06-08, boriskq.pw no longer has an IP address,
and GDPR prevents anyone from seeing who registered solfinesew.pw, but friggin yahoo.com
can leave my name, address, email and phone number hanging out in the breeze. Dickweeds.
