# ricches.php - email spamming tool

Highly flexible email spamming tool.

## Origin

Logged in to emulated WSO web shell directly, with a password.
This IP address did not try to log in to WordPress.

Code moved to honey pot via the `FilesMan` action, `uploadFile`
sub-action of WSO. A real WSO web shell would have created a
file named `ricches.php`.


## IP Address 176.123.10.248

`nslookup` says: 176-123-10-248.alexhost.md

`whois alexhost.md` says:

    organisation:   ORG-ALEX2-RIPE
    org-name:       ALEXHOST SRL
    org-type:       OTHER
    address:        str. 31 August 1989, 127, Chisinau, Moldova

Moldova. The proximal hop of `traceroute` goes through 87.255.71.238,
which is also registered to a Moldavan address, and apparently actually
near downtown Chisinau, 47°00'20.2"N 28°51'27.

## Analysis

No real decoding necessary, pretty-printing just to make it readable
helps a little.

The spamming parameters arrive in an HTTP cookie, set by the 
client calling the tool's URL.

A fairly versatile tool, just based on the parameters alone.

It can send email via PHP `mail()` builtin, or it can speak a subset of
SMTP by itself. It can send text or HTML email. It can pass through a SOCKS
server. It uses an elaborate system of 2-character codes to communicate
the spam's status to the sender.
