# Compromised theme simppelli

Looks like [simppelli](https://wordpress.org/themes/simppeli/) really does exist
as a WordPress theme.
This, however, is a kinked version of "simppeli",
modified in lots of nonsensical ways,
and containing a grab bag of miscellaneous malware.

## Origin

### Download

The attackers thought they were dealing with `/wp-admin/update.php`,
in "upload-theme" mode.
They downloaded a file named `simppelli.zip`.
A real WordPress install would have unzipped that file in the right place
for it to act as a theme.

### IP Address 107.175.218.241

107.175.218.241 has no A DNS record.

`whois` says it's a ColoCrossing IP address:

`traceroute` agrees.


`p0f3` says that Linux 3.1-3.10 runs that IP address.

## Analysis

The `README.md` file included in the kinked theme .zip file
has it as simppeli theme version 1.1.0.
Version 1.1.0 constitutes the latest version of the theme.

The theme's original .zip file has 39 files with a total of 117678 bytes, unzipped.
The kinked .zip file has 39 files,
named and dated (2017-02-05 12:47) exactly as the original .zip file.
The attacker went to some pains to cover where the bad code resides.
However, the kinked .zip file unzips to 191267 bytes.
Ten files' contents differ between original and compromised .zip files.

* `404.php` - completely changed, echoes "did not find,did not find"
* `footer.php` - a simple file uploader
* `inc/custom-header.php` - a simple "eval($_POST['something']);" style backdoor
* `inc/extras.php` - same [file uploader](sessions.php) as `footer.php`, concealed in PHP dropper
* `inc/jetpack.php` - the [GetDomains](../../GetDomains) recon malware
* `inc/template-tags.php` - probably a [ring.php](/plugins/login_wall/ring_decoded) web shell
* `single.php` - [heavily mutated WSO](wso.php) web shell
* `template-parts/content-search.php` - changes user's login to have WordPress admin privileges
* `template-parts/content-single.php` - changes user's login to have WordPress admin privileges
* `template-parts/content.php` - [changes user login](decoded_injectedcode.php) to have WordPress admin privileges

The PHP dropper code used by `inc/extras.php` appears in
[lots](../../backdoors/monero.php) of [other](../../backdoors/php.backdoor.vpsp.001) [malware](../../remailers/promos)
and probably deserves a bit of analysis all its own.

This is just a grab bag of crap.
Why have the same file uploader appear once in plain text,
the second time in a dropper used by lots of other malware?
Why does the GetDomains recon malware appear?
Why does `template-parts/content.php` inject code into both WordPress and Joomla files,
when it appears in a WordPress template?
Why do `template-parts/content-search.php`,
`template-parts/content-single.php` and `template-parts/content.php`
all have essentially the same code in them?
I'm quite confused by this.
There's no underlying theme or obvious motivation for including
this variety of malware.
There's no obvious reason for including duplicates.

One other puzzler that isn't quite so simple. `template-tags.php`
is clearly the same obfuscating method as the [ring.php](/plugins/login_wall/ring_decoded) backdoor.
It's borrowed the comments and function names of some random WordPress file, 
and changed them to hold gzipped, Base64-encoded, text representation
of some code.
The Base64-encoded, gzipped code representation is disguised as a pre-composed HTML &lt;img&gt; tage
with in-line image data.
Upon an HTTP request for `template-tags.php`,
the Base64-encoded text representation gets extracted from the "in-line image data".
If the HTTP request invoking `template-tags.php` has the correct
value of parameter named "l__l_", that code gets eval'ed.

None of the well-known passwords "root", "pass" or "avto",
or the `ring.php` password of "G0YgIaXqx" decodes this.
